# TwitchJS_NoBS
Really simple PLAIN JavaScript examples of connecting to Twitch through their API, EventSub, etc.

Not providing support for this nor am I intending to do any more work on it.  I just wanted to create a quick reference people can use to get started that has no other dependencies (no typscript, jquery, node, react, etc.).
